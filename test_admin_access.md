# Admin Access Instructions

## How to Access the Admin Panel

1. **Get your current app URL** - This should be your Replit project URL (usually ends with `.repl.co`)

2. **Add `/admin` to the end of your URL**
   - Example: `https://your-project-name.username.repl.co/admin`

3. **If you get "Page not found":**
   - Make sure you're using the correct domain (your Replit project URL)
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Make sure the app is running (check the workflow)

## Alternative Access Methods

If the direct URL doesn't work, you can:

1. **Navigate from the home page:**
   - Go to your app's main page
   - Manually type `/admin` at the end of the URL in your browser

2. **Use the browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Type: `window.location.href = '/admin'`

## What You Should See

Once you access `/admin`, you should see:
- Admin Authentication page
- Device fingerprint automatically generated
- Two-step verification form (device + email)

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Let me know the exact URL you're trying and any error messages you see. I can help troubleshoot or create a direct link for you.
