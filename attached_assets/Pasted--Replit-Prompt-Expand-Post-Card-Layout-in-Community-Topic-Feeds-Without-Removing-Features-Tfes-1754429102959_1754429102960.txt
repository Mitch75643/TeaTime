🛠️ Replit Prompt — Expand Post Card Layout in Community Topic Feeds Without Removing Features (Tfess)
📌 What I Need Replit to Do:
In the Community page, each topic section (like Hot Topics, Celebrity Tea, Story Time, etc.) currently displays posts inside a small, boxed feed area that limits readability and makes posts feel cramped.

I want to improve the layout of these topic feeds so they feel full-width and immersive, while preserving all the current UI features like tabs, filters, and headers.

✅ What to Change:
Only update the post container/card layout and feed border, not other elements.

Remove or reduce the small centered boxed area where posts currently sit.

Do not remove tabs, filters, or any special UI (e.g. "Your Posts", Story Filters, etc.)

The feed should expand to full width (or near full width) of the content container.

Each post card should:

Be visually larger

Have more padding

Be easier to scroll and read on all screen sizes

Make sure scrolling is natural and vertical, without nested or double scrolls.

Do not use embedded scroll boxes or modals — this should feel like a standard scrollable feed page.

✅ Must Keep:
✅ "Your Posts" tab in every section.

✅ Story Filters (like Horror, Funny, etc.) in Story Time.

✅ Celebrity Search in Celebrity Tea.

✅ Any post format logic that changes per topic (like Tea Experiments or Am I in the Wrong verdicts).

✅ Post cards should still display all relevant features (username, emojis, reactions, etc.).

✅ Apply This Post Card Layout Fix To:
Hot Topics

Celebrity Tea

Story Time

Daily Debate

Tea Experiments

Any other community topic feed using the cramped boxed layout

🚫 Do NOT Apply Layout Changes To:
The "Create First Post" button design — just center or align it better if needed.

Trending feed on the Home Page

Spill of the Day section on the Daily Spill page

Any modal or popup view — this is for full-page feed views only

✅ Final Result I Want:
A clean, modern, full-width post card layout on all community topic feeds

Scrollable like the Home Page feed or Daily Spill

Feels immersive and not confined

All current features and logic should remain fully visible and functional

Works across all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
