🛠️ Replit Prompt — Two-Step Admin Access (Fingerprint + Email) with Host-Only Control (Tfess)
I want to fully secure the admin system in my Tfess app using a two-step verification process for admins only — combining fingerprint and email. This should give me, the host, full control while keeping it invisible to regular users.

✅ Two-Step Admin Verification
Step 1 — Fingerprint Match:

Only I, the root host, can manually add trusted fingerprints via the Admin Panel.

When someone tries to access admin tools, their fingerprint must match a pre-approved admin fingerprint.

If it does, proceed to Step 2.

If it doesn’t match, block access immediately.

No other users (even current admins) can add fingerprints.

Step 2 — Admin-Only Email Verification:

Only admin-level users must pass this second step.

If a user passed Step 1, they must enter a valid admin email from a pre-approved list (added by me, the host).

✅ Match = grant full admin access.

❌ Mismatch = deny access.

This step should never be shown to regular users.

🔒 Admin Panel (Visible to Host Only)
Create an Admin Panel (only I can access) with the following functions:

✅ View current admin list (fingerprint + email)

✅ Add or remove admin fingerprints

✅ Add or remove admin emails

✅ Mark one fingerprint+email as the Root Host (me) — can’t be removed

❌ No other admin can add/remove fingerprints or emails

🚫 Admin Access Limits
✅ Admins are exempt from user restrictions, like:

Post cooldown timers

Post limits per day

Feed throttling systems

✅ Admins can’t remove or block each other — only I can remove admins.

✅ Admins cannot access any of this unless they pass both fingerprint and email checks.

🛡 User Rules
Regular users:

❌ Should never be prompted for email

❌ Cannot access or see any admin tools

❌ Cannot add/remove admins or fingerprints

✅ Are still limited by cooldowns and posting limits

🔁 Device or Host Migration
If I switch devices or hosts:

Allow me to pre-add a new fingerprint + email pair to preserve my Root Admin access.

My admin access must always stay protected and transferable only by me.
