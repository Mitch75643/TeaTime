Replit Prompt ‚Äî Build Smart Anti-Spam System Without Blocking Real User Activity (Tfess)

I want to add a system to prevent users from spamming low-quality or excessive posts, but I do not want to discourage active or enthusiastic participation. It should feel invisible to regular users and only affect those behaving abusively.

This should apply across the entire Tfess app ‚Äî including:

Home Page

Daily Spill Page

All Community Topic Pages (Celebrity Tea, Story Time, Hot Topics, Tea Experiments, Daily Debate, Feedback/Suggestions, etc.)

If a user makes 1 post on Home and 2 on Daily Spill, it should count as 3 posts toward the limit.

üîß System Logic:

Post Frequency Limit (Soft Throttle)

Allow up to 10 posts per 15 minutes total across all pages (adjustable ‚Äî e.g., 3 posts).

After that, show a friendly message:‚Äúüí¨ Looks like you're on a roll! Try spacing out your posts so others can join the convo too.‚Äù

Do not fully block, but encourage a pause.

Content Similarity Filter

Detect if a user posts nearly identical content multiple times.

If repeated spam is detected, show:‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Posting the same thing repeatedly could limit your account visibility.‚Äù

Duplicate Link or Keyword Flagging

If the same link, emoji, or word pattern is used across multiple recent posts, log that user and temporarily hide those posts from public view pending review.

Invisible Rate Limiting (Per Device/User)

Apply quiet back-end limits using device fingerprint or user session:

Temporarily throttle post visibility if someone is flooding without actual engagement (likes, comments, replies).

Limit posting not by a hard block, but by reducing exposure.

Progressive Feedback

First offense: Gentle tooltip warning.

Second: Slower post visibility or soft cooldown.

Repeat offenders: Auto-flagged for admin review or silent shadowban.

Whitelist Active Community Builders

Users who consistently get engagement (likes, replies) can be exempted from strict spam filters.

No UI Friction for Normal Users

All real users should be able to post as usual if they aren‚Äôt triggering suspicious patterns.

The system should never break the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of someone excited to share ‚Äî only react to suspicious abuse patterns.
