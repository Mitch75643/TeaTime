For each Community topic, add a unique animation and calm, fun sound that plays right after a post is submitted. These should reflect the theme of the topic, just like how ‚ÄúCheese‚Äù is used as a fun idea for Tea Experiments. Here's the breakdown for each:

---

### 1. **Celebrity Tea**  
- **Visual**: A paparazzi camera flash animation (not blinding), with sparkles and flashing star icons  
- **Sound**: A gentle camera click + excited ‚Äúooh!‚Äù background murmur  
- **Vibe**: Like a celeb got spotted!

---

### 2. **Story Time**  
- **Visual**: A glowing open book animation, with sparkles rising out like magical dust  
- **Sound**: A soft page-turn + twinkle sound  
- **Vibe**: Like a story is being unlocked

### 3. **Hot Topics**  
- **Visual**: A fiery flame emoji flickers on screen, maybe with a mini fire trail under the post  
- **Sound**: Low, soft fire crackle or sizzle (not annoying!)  
- **Vibe**: Like something just dropped and it's üî•

### 4. **Daily Debate**  
- **Visual**: Animated thought bubbles or question marks pop in, then fade  
- **Sound**: A soft ‚Äúhmm‚Äù thinking sound or subtle gavel tap  
- **Vibe**: Like a respectful challenge just began

### 5. **Tea Experiments**  
- **Visual**: Bubbling beaker or test tube, colored liquid mixing or fizzing  
- **Sound**: A playful fizz-pop or soft ‚Äúcheese!‚Äù voice (fun experiment shout)  
- **Vibe**: Like launching a weird science test or meme-worthy experiment

### 6. **Feedback & Suggestions**  
- **Visual**: Lightbulb icon appears with a gentle pulse, maybe spark animation  
- **Sound**: Calm "ding" of realization or a quiet scribble sound  
- **Vibe**: Like an idea was just dropped into the suggestion box

**General Notes:**
- Each effect (visual + sound) should only appear after the post is successfully submitted.
- Keep all effects brief (1‚Äì2 seconds) and not too loud.
- Must work well on mobile and desktop.
- Optional: Let users disable effects from settings if they want.

All animations should feel smooth, expressive, and match the TeaSpill vibe ‚Äî fun, clever, and drama-ready!
