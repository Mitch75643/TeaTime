🛠️ Replit Prompt — URGENT: Community Topics Crashing on Post Submission (Tfess)
❗ CRITICAL ISSUE:
In the Community page of my Tfess app, ALL topic sections are crashing when a user tries to submit a post.

🔍 What’s Happening:
When a post is submitted under any Community topic (e.g. Hot Topics, Celebrity Tea, Story Time, etc.):

The app freezes or crashes immediately.

Sometimes the form resets, other times the app navigates away or locks up.

The submitted post either:

Never shows up

Or breaks the UI completely

This affects all Community topic sections, not just one.

Posts do not appear in the Community feed after submitting — user sees nothing or is stuck.

✅ What I Need Replit to Fix:
Stability Fix:

Submitting a post in any Community topic must not crash or reload the app.

Prevent null references or state mismatch issues after post submission.

Fix Feed Rendering Logic:

Posts should appear immediately in the correct Community feed once submitted.

Prevent feed from going blank or freezing.

Cross-Device Visibility:

Once posted, the post should also show up on other devices (like it does in Home or Trending).

Confirm real-time sync or load on refresh.

Preserve Form and Navigation:

Do not reset the form and throw the user back to the post screen if the post is submitted successfully.

Take the user to the Community Feed tab where their post appears.

🧪 How to Test the Fix:
Go to any Community topic (e.g. Story Time).

Click “+ Create Post” and submit a new post.

Confirm:

✅ App does NOT crash or freeze

✅ Post appears in the Community Feed immediately

✅ Post shows on other devices

✅ No visual or form errors appear

🧠 Additional Context:
This functionality was working fine before under the checkpoint titled:
“Update feeds to show fewer posts and require manual refreshes.”
Please review the diff from that checkpoint if needed — the current behavior is a regression from that working state.

🚨 Priority Level:
This is a critical stability issue affecting core app functionality — please fix this ASAP to restore proper posting in all Community sections.
