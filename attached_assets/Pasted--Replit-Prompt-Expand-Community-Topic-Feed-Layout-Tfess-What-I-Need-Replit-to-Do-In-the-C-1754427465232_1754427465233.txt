🛠️ Replit Prompt — Expand Community Topic Feed Layout (Tfess)
📌 What I Need Replit to Do:
In the Community page, each individual topic (like Hot Topics, Celebrity Tea, Story Time, etc.) currently displays posts in a small, boxed feed area. This limits the visual experience and makes posts harder to read or scroll through.

I want the layout of these Community Topic feeds to be improved to feel more full-screen and immersive, matching the modern feed layout standards used elsewhere in the app.

✅ What to Change:
Remove or significantly reduce the bordered container that the feed is currently in (see screenshot).

Feeds like Hot Topics are confined to a small centered box.

Make the feed expand full width (or nearly full width) within the content area of the screen.

Increase vertical spacing and layout size:

Posts should appear larger, with better padding and spacing.

Use a layout style that matches the feed from the Home Page or Daily Spill for consistency.

Make the feed scrollable normally (vertically) just like other feed pages.

Avoid double-scroll or small embedded scroll containers.

Content should feel like a fluid feed, not like a restricted card inside a modal.

✅ Apply this change to ALL Community Topic pages, including:

Hot Topics

Celebrity Tea

Story Time

Daily Debate

Tea Experiments

Any others that use this same small feed layout

🚫 Do NOT apply these layout changes to:
The "Create First Post" button design — that can stay the same, just reposition it better if needed.

Trending feed on Home Page

Daily Spill’s Spill of the Day section

Modals or popups — only apply to the full-page feed views

✅ Final Result I Want:
A full-width, modern, scrollable feed layout for all Community Topic pages

Bigger, easier-to-read posts

Users shouldn’t feel cramped or confined when viewing posts in those sections

It should feel visually consistent with the Home Page and Daily Spill feeds

Let me know if you need this adapted for dark/light mode styling too.
