Update the appâ€™s color theme from pink/purple to an orange palette, but follow these specific rules:

---

ðŸŽ¨ New Orange Theme Base:

- Primary Orange: `#FF7A00`
- Soft Orange Background: `#FFE5D1`
- Darker Orange for shadows or active: `#CC6200`
- Accent/Highlight: `#FFD8B2`
- Text (dark): `#3C2E20`

---

âœ… Areas to Change:

1. **Global UI (Nav, Buttons, Page Transitions, Bottom of Pages):**
   - Change all pink/purple accents, hover states, and transitions to use the orange theme.
   - The bottom gradient or highlight color at the base of pages should now be orange (`#FF7A00` or gradient).
   - When switching pages (clicking a tab or route), use orange glow or animation instead of pink.

2. **Daily Spill Page:**
   - **Keep the Weekly Prompt Box Header Red** as originally designed.
   - **Only change the background and supporting UI colors** on the Daily Spill page (submit button, post area, icons) to the orange theme.
   - Use a clean contrast between the red prompt box and the new orange post area.

3. **All Buttons and Modals Across App:**
   - Replace pink/purple styles with the orange palette above.
   - Hover states should use lighter orange.
   - Modal headers and footers should match the new theme.

ðŸš« Do NOT Change:

1. **Community Page Tiles (Celebrity Tea, Story Time, etc.):**
   - Keep their **original colors** (each tile has its own theme).
   - Do not apply any orange theme to the tiles or their borders.
   - Keep individual topic colors intact for branding and variety.

2. **Weekly Prompt Header in Daily Spill:**
   - Leave it as the **original red** â€” this is intentional and should **not** match the orange theme.

3. **Icons inside Category Tiles:**
   - Do not recolor any icons inside the Community or Daily Spill tiles unless they were pink before â€” revert those to their original.

ðŸ“± Mobile & Visual Tips:

- Make sure the new orange color has strong visibility on mobile without hurting contrast.
- Donâ€™t oversaturate; use a warm, inviting orange, not neon.
- All transitions (like swiping or switching tabs) should use orange highlights now instead of purple.

ðŸ§© Summary:
- Orange is the new global theme
- Keep Community and Daily Spill tile colors the same
- Restore original red for the Daily Spill prompt header
- Convert all navigation, page switching, and modals to orange
- Orange color should feel bold and expressive, not harsh
