📋 Replit Prompt — Auto-Rotate Content (Prompts, Leaderboards, Themes) in Tfess
I want to automatically rotate time-sensitive content in the Tfess app — including prompts, debates, trending posts, and leaderboards — on a daily, weekly, or every-3-days basis. It should require no manual updates, and ensure prompts never repeat.

✅ Content to Auto-Rotate
🏠 Home Page
Show a Trending Feed that resets every 3 days.

Based on most liked or commented posts in the last 72 hours.

After reset, recalculate new top 10 from current data.

🧠 Daily Spill Page
Display a Daily Prompt that updates every 24 hours.

Pull from a master list of pre-written prompts.

Each prompt must be unique and never reused — even across weeks or months.

When the list runs low, fallback behavior can be:

Stop showing new prompts and display a message.

Or allow admins to inject more prompts.

Display a Weekly Theme that changes every 7 days.

Example: “Friendship Week”, “Embarrassing Moments Week”

Resets on a rolling 7-day cycle or every Monday at midnight.

👥 Community Page
🎤 Celebrity Tea
Show a Weekly Top 5 Celebrity Leaderboard.

Based on mentions or tagged posts from past 7 days.

Reset every week with a new leaderboard.

Repetition of celeb names over weeks is okay.

🔥 Hot Topics
Show a Weekly Top 5 Discussions Leaderboard.

Based on top-performing posts in the Hot Topics section.

Resets every 7 days automatically.

⚖️ Daily Debates
Show a new Daily Debate Prompt every 24 hours.

Pull from a list of debate-style prompts.

Each debate must be unique and never repeat.

Track used prompts in the database.

🧪 Tea Experiments
Run 1 new community experiment per day.

Clears results from the previous day.

Resets daily at midnight or rolling 24-hour timer.

🔁 How the Auto-Rotation Works
Use a scheduler (setInterval, cron, or timestamp comparison logic).

Daily content: refresh every 24 hours

3-day content: refresh every 72 hours

Weekly content: refresh every 7 days (rolling or fixed)

Store each rotation cycle in the database with a timestamp and a used/unused prompt flag.

When the expiration time passes:

Replace expired content with new content.

For prompts, ensure no repeats — pull only from unused prompts.

The system should rotate content automatically even if users don’t refresh the app.

⚠️ Additional Rules
Do not repeat any prompt (daily or debate) ever — once used, it’s permanently marked as used.

Leaderboards (Trending, Celebs, Hot Topics) can show repeated items if they naturally rank again.

Users should see updates smoothly, without having to reload the app.

Optionally show banners like:

“🎯 New Debate Just Dropped!” or “🔥 Leaderboard Reset!”
