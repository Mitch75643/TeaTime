On the Daily Spill page, when a user submits a post, trigger a unique visual animation and soft sound effect based on the current week’s theme (e.g., Love Week, Pet Peeves Week, etc.). This should make posting feel expressive, relevant, and fun — and vary depending on the week.

🧠 System Behavior:
- After a successful post submission, check what the current week’s theme is (this is already shown at the top of the Daily Spill page).
- Based on the theme, trigger a **matching animation + sound effect.**
- Effects should feel fun, lightweight, expressive, and mobile-friendly.

🎨 Example Weekly Themes and Effects:

1. **❤️ Love Week**
   - Visual: Red and pink hearts float upward from the post
   - Sound: Soft romantic chime or gentle heart “bloop”

2. **😤 Pet Peeves Week**
   - Visual: Angry face emojis or scribbles pop up briefly
   - Sound: Quiet grumble or eye-roll sound (funny but not loud)

3. **😂 Cringe/Funny Week**
   - Visual: “😂” emojis or comic-style “LOL” bubbles burst and fade
   - Sound: Playful giggle or light cartoon boing (very subtle)

4. **🤫 Secrets Week**
   - Visual: Whisper bubbles or shushing face float up and fade
   - Sound: Whisper “shhh” or light wind noise

5. **😳 Embarrassing Moments Week**
   - Visual: Blush emojis or sweat drops pop and fade
   - Sound: Soft gasp or light "oops" chime

6. **🔥 Drama Week**
   - Visual: Floating drama masks 🎭 or explosive text bubbles
   - Sound: A soft dramatic sting or rising suspense tone

7. **✨ Self-Care Week**
   - Visual: Calm sparkle or glowing wellness icons (like candles or leaves)
   - Sound: Soft spa-like chime or gentle breath sound

🧩 Custom Logic:
- If no theme is found for the week, default to a light sparkle animation and soft “sent” swoosh sound.
- Must be expandable to support more themes later.
- No sound or animation should block interaction — should last 1.5–2 seconds max.
- Effects must work well on mobile and desktop.
- All sounds must be calm, non-intrusive, and match the emotional tone of each theme.

Bonus: Store visual/sound mappings in a config so future theme changes are easy to update.
