In the "Hot Topics" section under the Community page, combine the “View Takes” feed with the Community Feed / Your Posts structure so that everything is connected, clean, and filterable.

🧩 Structural Changes:

1. **Unified Feed Layout:**
   - Display the feed in one connected UI block with a toggle or segmented control for:
     - [All Takes] (shows all)
     - [Your Takes] (shows posts submitted by the user)
   - These two views should be side-by-side or tab-switched within the same component (not separate sections or stacked).

2. **Topic-Based Filtering:**
   - Use the Top 5 Hot Topics from the “This Week’s Hottest Discussions” leaderboard as filter buttons above the feed.
   - When a user clicks one of these topic buttons:
     - Filter both “All Takes” and “Your Takes” to only show responses to that specific hot topic.
     - Visually highlight the selected topic filter.

3. **Post Behavior:**
   - When a user submits a post via the "+ Respond" button or from the post modal, the selected topic is tagged with the post.
   - The feed should automatically show the new post in the correct filtered view.

4. **Default View:**
   - By default, show “All Takes” with no filter applied.
   - If a filter is selected (e.g. “Should tipping be mandatory?”), only show posts for that topic across both views.

🎨 UI Guidelines:

- Make the feed toggle (All / Your) and the topic filter bar visually cohesive.
- Use compact tabs or pills for the 5 hot topics (truncate if text is long).
- Feed cards should visually indicate which topic they’re responding to.
- Support mobile responsiveness: toggle and filters should stack neatly on small screens.

💬 Empty State Behavior:

- If no responses exist for a selected topic, show:
  “No takes on this yet. Be the first to weigh in!” + a `+ Respond` button prefilled with that topic.

🚫 Don’t:
- Don’t change the leaderboard design.
- Don’t remove or rename the existing topics.
- Don’t break existing submission flow — just tag and filter accordingly.
- Don’t apply this logic to other community sections.
