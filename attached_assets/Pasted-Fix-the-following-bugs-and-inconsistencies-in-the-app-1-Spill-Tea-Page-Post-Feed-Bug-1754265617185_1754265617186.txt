Fix the following bugs and inconsistencies in the app:

---

1. **Spill Tea Page – Post Feed Bug**
- Issue: When someone submits a new post on the Spill Tea page, it doesn’t show up in the recent posts feed.
- Fix: Ensure newly submitted posts automatically appear in the recent post feed without needing to refresh. Use real-time updates or re-fetch the data after a post is made.

2. **Mobile Reply/Comment UI Bug**
- Issue: On mobile, when trying to type a reply or comment, a black box or overlay covers the input area, making it impossible to see what you're typing.
- Fix: Adjust mobile UI so that the comment input stays visible when the keyboard opens. Ensure the view scrolls correctly and that the input box stays above any overlays or containers.

3. **Notification System – Username Mismatch**
- Issue: Notifications show the wrong display name when someone replies to a comment — it's not matching the sender’s current username.
- Fix: Make sure the name shown in notifications always matches the latest username from that user's profile settings.

4. **Notification Click Behavior**
- Issue: Clicking a notification doesn’t take the user to the correct place or highlight what triggered the notification.
- Fix: When a user clicks a notification, navigate them directly to the exact comment, reply, or post that triggered it. Also, highlight the related action briefly so it’s clear what the notification was about.

5. **Username Consistency Throughout the App**
- Issue: Usernames are randomly changing across the app, even when the user hasn’t edited their profile.
- Fix: Ensure that usernames are stored and referenced correctly across all parts of the app. They should only change if the user explicitly updates their username in the settings.
- Make sure all post/comment displays, notifications, replies, and feeds consistently show the correct username for each user.

⚙️ Additional Notes:
- Test all changes on both desktop and mobile views.
- Ensure there are no caching or state issues causing the wrong data to show.
- Maintain performance and responsiveness with these fixes in place.
