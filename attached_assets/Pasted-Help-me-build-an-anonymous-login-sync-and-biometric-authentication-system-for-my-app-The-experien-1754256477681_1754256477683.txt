Help me build an anonymous login, sync, and biometric authentication system for my app. The experience must remain fully anonymous — no names, no profile photos, and no personal data.

Here’s what I need:

1. Login Page:
- Create a login screen with two clear options:
  a. “Log In to Sync Your Anonymous Account” — where the user can enter a secure passphrase or (optionally) email to access their saved anonymous data.
  b. “Stay Anonymous” — this button skips login and generates a new anonymous ID stored locally.
- No personal information should ever be required.
- Use a clean and modern UI design.

2. Settings Page:
- Add a button labeled “Set Up Cross-Device Sync.”
- When clicked, allow the anonymous user to create a passphrase or (optionally) provide an email to enable account syncing across devices.
- Store their anonymous ID securely for syncing.
- Do not make this mandatory — it’s optional unless the user wants to log in on another device.

3. Biometric Login (Face ID / Fingerprint):
- After a user sets up sync, offer an option to enable biometric login.
- When enabled:
  - Store their login token or anonymous ID securely using platform-secure storage (Keychain for iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences or Keystore for Android).
  - Use biometric authentication (Face ID or fingerprint) on future app launches to unlock that stored ID and log the user in.
  - If Face ID fails or is unavailable, show fallback options: manual login or “Stay Anonymous.”
- Ensure no biometric data is ever stored or sent to a server — only used for local unlock.

4. Behavior:
- If a user logs in with passphrase or email, load their synced data tied to their anonymous ID.
- If they skip login, generate a new anonymous ID and start fresh on that device.
- All authentication and sync methods must preserve anonymity.

5. Privacy & Security:
- Never request or store real names, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers.
- All data should be kept local or securely stored server-side using anonymous IDs only.
- No analytics, tracking, or fingerprinting — just anonymous interaction and data protection.

The goal is: complete anonymity with optional secure syncing and convenient biometric access — all without compromising user privacy.
