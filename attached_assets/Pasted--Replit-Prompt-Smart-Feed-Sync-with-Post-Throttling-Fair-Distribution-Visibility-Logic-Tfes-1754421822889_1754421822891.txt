🛠️ Replit Prompt — Smart Feed Sync with Post Throttling, Fair Distribution & Visibility Logic (Tfess)
📌 What I Need Replit to Do:
I'm building for scale and want the feed system on Tfess to handle high post volume without flooding users, while also ensuring posts get visibility even if 100+ users post at once.

🔄 Part 1: Smart Post Distribution (Anti-Flooding)
Do NOT flood the screen with dozens of new posts when thousands of users are posting. I want the following logic applied:

🔹 When Refreshing (Manual or "Tap to View"):
Only show 20–30 of the newest posts max per refresh.

If more than 30 new posts exist, queue the rest for the next refresh.

Never show more than 30 new posts per load — keeps feed readable.

🔹 Live Posting Behavior:
New posts do NOT appear automatically.

Only show them after the user taps “Refresh” or “New Post – Tap to View.”

Banner still says “🔄 X New Posts – Tap to View” when there are more than 0 new posts.

🎯 Part 2: Post Visibility Fairness Logic
When many users post at the same time (e.g., 100+), I don’t want them to show in pure time order (first = bottom). I want fair visibility, so that everyone gets seen.

Implement This Logic:
Distribute incoming posts among users randomly in small batches:

Example: if 100 users post → break into chunks of ~10–15

Each user gets a different subset of posts from that group

No one’s post gets permanently buried

Add randomization logic to which posts a user sees in the “New” section on the Home Page.

✨ Part 3: Prioritize Posts Needing Attention (With Limits)
In the “New” section, add a chance-based visibility boost to posts with low or no engagement.

Rules:
On each feed refresh, use a chance-based boost:

10–20% chance to include a post with 0 reactions or 0 comments

10–20% chance to include a post with low reactions/comments

⚠️ These boosted posts should be sprinkled in, not dominate the feed. Don’t make it too obvious or repetitive.

Only show this behavior in the New section of the Home Page.

✅ Part 4: Real-Time Interactions (Comments, Reactions, Polls)
Make sure the following elements update live for all users across devices:

Votes in polls

Emoji reactions

Comment counts

Live comment threads

Edits to profile pics and usernames (if updated by users)

Use Firebase onSnapshot or WebSockets if needed.

✅ Part 5: Cross-Device & Performance Rules
Always prevent showing stale data (like old posts or incorrect usernames).

Prevent UI flooding or jittery refreshes.

Use virtual lists or lazy loading to avoid mobile slowdown.

Apply this behavior to:

Home Page

Daily Spill

All Community Topic Pages

Profile Feeds (if needed)

✅ Once implemented, confirm:

Feeds are balanced.

New content doesn’t flood users.

Engagement is fairly distributed.

Live syncing works without manual refreshes
