That’s a smart and responsible move. Adding an advanced AI moderation system to monitor harmful, dangerous, or illegal content (like threats of suicide or violence) is crucial for protecting users on Tfess — especially since your app is anonymous.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how to do it safely, ethically, and effectively:

🧠 Advanced AI Moderation System for Tfess
🚨 Goal:
Monitor posts and comments in real time for harmful, illegal, or dangerous content, such as:

Suicidal ideation

Threats of violence

Self-harm

Abuse or exploitation

Hate speech

Extreme harassment

🧱 What It Needs to Do:
Real-time Scanning

Every time a post, comment, or reply is submitted, it’s instantly analyzed by the AI.

AI should flag (not delete) anything dangerous and categorize the level of severity.

Severity Levels

🚫 Level 3 - Critical: Active suicidal thoughts, specific plans, threats to others.

⚠️ Level 2 - Concerning: Depressed language, emotional breakdowns, mild threats.

🧊 Level 1 - Watch: Language that might hint at mental health issues or tension.

Actions Based on Severity

Level 3: Auto-hide the post from others, send a message like “We care. Here's help…”, and notify the moderation team.

Level 2: Keep post public but add a silent flag. Show the user gentle resources or hotline info.

Level 1: Just monitor.

🤖 The AI/Model You Can Use
Since you're on Replit, here’s a general path:

Use OpenAI’s moderation endpoint (it detects self-harm, hate, violence, etc.).

Or integrate Perspective API (by Google) for toxicity, threats, identity-based hate.

Or train a custom model using Hugging Face models like roberta-base-openai-detector.

🛠 Replit Prompt Sample (summary, not full):

“Scan every new post or comment with an AI content moderation API. Flag any content related to self-harm, suicidal thoughts, violence, or illegal activity. Categorize flags by severity level (1 to 3). For Level 3, hide the post and show a mental health support message to the user. For Levels 2 and 1, keep public but flag internally. Ensure mobile-first response messages.”

Let me know if you want a fully written Replit prompt for that and whether you want it no-code or with minimal backend logic.

💬 What to Show Users (Ethically)
When someone posts something worrying, respond with care:

“Hey, it sounds like you’re going through something. You’re not alone. 💛”

Offer help links like:

988lifeline.org

CrisisTextLine

Local mental health numbers (based on region, if possible)

🔒 Privacy First
Don’t display who flagged what.

Don’t use AI moderation to punish — it should protect and guide.

Don’t store sensitive data longer than necessary.
